#MICB475: Data Science Research in Microbiology 2025W Group 11

Meeting 2 Agenda

Prepared by Nicholas Kwok

Date: Tuesday Oct 7 
Time: 2:00 – 2:45 PM 
Location: LSI 1510 
Notetaker: Luna

1. Administrative Updates
  - Confirm all members have access to the GitHub repo and uploaded “Possible Datasets” PDF. (Jason?)
  - Add Hans to the repo (verify permissions).
  - Review timeline: Finalize dataset choice this week → draft research question by Oct 14 meeting.

2. Dataset Evaluation 
  - Objective: Narrow from topic options (COVID, Infant Feeding, Smoking/Vaping, Sepsis) to one theme based on data quality and novelty.
  
    Discussion Prompts:
      - Evelyn’s feedback identified three COVID studies with usable metadata (Wei et al. 2023; Serrato et al. 2023; Newsome et al. 2021).
      - Compare COVID vs Infant Feeding vs Sepsis vs Smoking datasets for:
        Metadata completeness (accession IDs, n size, geographic range)
        Microbiome site (oral, gut, saliva, fecal)
        Novelty / previous analyses (saturation of literature)
        Feasibility of downloading and processing (16S vs metagenomic)
            
  - *Final Goal: Vote for top two datasets to pilot in QIIME2.*
  
3. Research Question Brainstorm 

Each member pitches 1–2 potential questions based on the shortlisted dataset(s).
Check that questions fit the “novel and analyzable” criteria.

4. Division of Work
  - Based on chosen theme (COVID/smoking/infant/Sepsis), Assign tasks for remaining dataset groups:

    Proposed division of work:
    - (If there are more than 1 explorable themes, 2 members analyze metadata + come up w/ novel research questions of each theme.)
    - (If there is only 1 explorable theme, 2 members try to come up with novel research questions, 2 analyze the metadata.
  
    Tasks before Meeting 3:
    - Confirm data availability & metadata quality.
    - Import one dataset into QIIME2 and generate a basic summary (ASV table, metadata linking).
    - Start a shared Google Doc for research-question drafting.
    
5. Next Steps & Deadlines 

  - Finalize chosen dataset by Oct 10 (Fri) for approval by Evelyn.
  - Write and upload a concise research question + hypothesis to GitHub by Oct 14 (Tues).
  - Next meeting (Oct 14) → review initial analyses in QIIME2. 




Meeting 1 

Minutes prepared by Nicholas Kwok.

People present: Evelyn, Hans, Jason, Luna, Thomas, Nicholas 

Notetaker: Nicholas Kwok

Expectations: 
- Write agenda every meeting. Can ask Hans over the weekend if we have any questions
- We need a notetaker every meeting (can rotate).
- Add Hans into the Github next week
- Has to be a novel research question. Have to finalize by end of this week if we are thinking of a new one. 

Notes: 
- We want a novel research question, something that hasn't been done before. 
- Use AI to find  datasets specific conditions?
- Parkinsons is saturated
- Multiple Sclerosis is also saturated?
- Alcohol Consumption dataset? Has not been widely used before, possible choice 
- Smoking and vaping dataset
- Write down possible questions, find niche questions online
- Pick something you're interested in!
- Has to be centered around the microbiome
- Bacteria mediated COVID immunity? (Nick)
- Gut microbiome Sepsis (Jason) 
- Smoking (Thomas) 
- Infant (Luna)
- Thursday, groupchat discussion after finding 10-15 datasets on our topic, then deciding on which topic we want
- ask in group if we have questions

Admin:
- Moved meetings to tuesdays for Meeting 2 and 3 (7th Oct, 14th Oct 2:00pm-2:45pm)
- Finish data 2 weeks before presentation (first meeting talk about story, talk about slides, second meeting make edits)
